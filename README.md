Fuzzy c-means clustering
====

## Overview
Implementation of a clustering algorithm using the fuzzy c-means [1].

The "Fuzzy_c-means_clustering.py", includes two clustering methods namely k-means and fuzzy c-means, which can applly to any clustering application.


## Requirement
matplotlib 3.1.0

numpy 1.18.1

scipy 1.4.1


## Dataset preparation
You can apply this traditional clustering method to any application you want. An example of COVID-19 statistics has been prepared for the demonstration.
